The purpose of this web application is to provide bootcamp students with a fun resource for studying class material. It consists of 3 multiple choice questions related to JavaScript.

To use this web application click the "start" button to begin. The user will be presented with the first question and a 60 second timer. If the user chooses the correct answer 1 point will be added to their score and they will move on to question 2. If the user chooses an incorrect answer 15 seconds will be subtracted from the timer and they will move on to question 2. The quiz carries on in this fashion and ends when either there are no more questions or the timer runs out. At the conclusion of the quiz the user will have the opportunity to save their score.
